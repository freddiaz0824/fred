## Projects and Professional Development
### Undergraduate Thesis: Development of a Water Cooler and Circulator using Thermoelectric Configuration for Labaratory Use
One of the requirements to complete my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering is to produce a research project that could benefit the engineering aspect. Our beloved professor suggested researching a prototype that has the ability to cool a medium, as he mentioned that one of the newly purchase laboratory equipment requires a water bath to perform experiments. 

My group has come up with an idea to create a prototype of a water cooler and water bath that can lower a liquid’s temperature by using thermoelectric modules for the chiller. The significance of this study is to provide additional equipment to the UST Mechanical Engineering Labaratory that will cater to different experimental set-ups, especially for viscosity measurements requiring varying temperatures. 

In addition, future Mechanical Engineering students will benefit from this equipment by applying the principle of the vapor compression cycle using thermoelectric coolers (TEC) as a water cooler.

### Procurement Associate: Procurement Division 
After passing the board examination, I was acquired as a Procurement Associate at Petron Corporation, this serves as my first job after completing my Bachelor Degree.

As a Procurement Associate, My main responsibility is to review purchase order request, communication with vendors and proponents, negotiation of price, delivery lead time, and warranty. During my tenure at Petron Corporation, I developed several skills that would greatly benefit the role of Graduate Design Engineer:

### Technical Knowledge of materials
  As a procurement associate, I learned to understand the properties and applications of the materials I was purchasing. This knowledge is vital in design     engineering, where selecting the right materials can significantly impact product performance, sustainability, and cost efficiency.

### Specification Analysis
  As a procurement associate, analyzing specifications is one of my key responsibilities.In design engineering, understanding specifications ensures that the design meets the necessary requirements and standards.

### Cost Analysis and Budgeting 
  As a procurement associate, Cost Analysis and Budgeting is vital skill in my role, In design engineering, these skills allows me to design innovative products that are also economically viable. My ability to evaluate costs can help ensure that products remain affordable in the market.

### Problem Solving
  As a procurement associate, I often faced challenges such as supply chain disruptions or vendor issues. I believe my problem-solving abilites will be beneficial in design engineering, where I will inevitably encounter technical challenges that require innovative solutions. 

_Skills: analytical skills, technical mindset, understanding context, big-picture thinking, detail-oriented thinking_
