## Talks & Lectures
### UST ECE Board Testimonials (_Speaker_)

As a speaker at the board examination testimonial, I shared my journey as a **top 9 performer** in the **electronics engineering board exam**. I offered valuable advice, emphasizing resilience and a growth mindset. Moreover, I presented a sample schedule, highlighting balanced study periods and shared quotes emphasizing perseverance. I advised the students as if I was talking to my past self -- at times when I was feeling lost during the review. I want to inspire the next generation of Electronics Engineers who will take the board exam.
